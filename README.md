## Testing plugin

- Compile plugin as .dll
- Copy output .dll file to **plugins** folder in TeamSpeak (32-bit) installation directory
- Reload plugins in TS3 client (disable old one first if the plugin was already loaded)


## Setting a menu icon

- Create a new folder with the same name as the .dll file in the **plugins** folder in the TS3 installation directory
- Put a 16x16 image called **icon.png** in this new folder
